In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.


**[Demo](https://youtu.be/fBIj8YsA9dk)**.

* You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

  * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

### My Project

* This is a trivia quiz based on the Wild West. It's a bunch of random facts that are probably very obscured and honestly pointless. 

* This project includes three different "levels" someone can obtain. 
        0-3 points will give the user the lowest level.
        4-6 points will give the user a good work.
        7-10 points will give the user a badge for their efforts. 

* Their is a timer that reflects a timer. The numbers will begin to turn red upon the 10 second countdown.

* Used css properties to hide overflow of images, also added css animations to the bottom.

* Includes the use of music in assignment.
